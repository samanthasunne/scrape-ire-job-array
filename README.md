# scrape-ire-job-array
This is a test script that scrapes the job postings on the IRE job board in an array.

This script is associated with my tutorial "[Scraping with code](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a1YGFV_5NYt9AcPaJU3miMKAAlHoTNGbj56HCNa296E/edit?usp=sharing)." You may want to check there for dependencies.

Open the [script.gs](https://github.com/samanthasunne/scrape-ire-job-array/blob/master/script.gs) file and copy and paste it into your Google Apps Script file.
